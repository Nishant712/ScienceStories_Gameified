# ScienceStories_Gameified
***The StoryLab at Texas A&M Android Wear Application***

### Purpose
The purpose of this application is to create an informal science learning application on a wearable device. This program can then be modified based on the scope of the study for future potential publications.

### Prompts
Prompts are used to help aid the students in science reflection focused around three steps of the scientific method.

There are three different types of prompts for this application:
* What around you may be related to [Science Topic]?  - Observation
* How can what you are doing relate to [Science Topic]? - Activity
* Do something related to [Science Topic]. Tell me about it. - Experiment

### Gamification of the application - Change in bird according to the number of recordings in each prompt.
To make the application more engaging and intuitive, there is a bird which grows as more recordings are done. As there are three types of prompts, the bird changes in a different way for each prompt.

### Class Initialization
The application loads initially into the MainActivity class, displaying the vocabulary of the science lesson the user is learning.
- - - -
### Recording Notes
To compensate Android Wear from being unable to record using the general Android recording class, the MessageRecord class contains code to record an audio stream into a .PCM file. This .PCM file is then given a header, translated into a .WAV file, and the .PCM is then deleted. The application then uses the .WAV file for audio playback in the ChapterCollection class.

### Other Classes

#### BirdBefore
Displays the current state of the bird.

#### BirdAfter
Displays the state of the bird after a recording has been done.
